I thought this would already exist but an extension where you can keep track of shopping wish lists from as many websites as you want. Sure, you could just make a folder of bookmarks, but what if you don't feel like clicking the link to see it again? And maybe Amazon already has something similar, but it's just to find that item on Amazon, and when trying to download it it asked for way more permissions than it really needs.
